# The Nature Capsule - Closed-Loop Life Support for Mars

A revolutionary bioregenerative life support system that transforms waste into life on Mars. This project presents The Nature Capsule, a sustainable solution for human habitation at Jezero Crater through closed-loop recycling and biological regeneration.

## 🌟 Overview

The Nature Capsule is a groundbreaking closed-loop bioregenerative life support system designed for sustainable human habitation on Mars. It transforms waste into oxygen, food, water, and materials through a revolutionary 10-stage process, enabling decades-long missions without Earth resupply.

## 🚀 Features

- **Closed-Loop Design**: Waste In → Resources Out
- **10-Stage Process**: From waste collection to automated safety
- **Bioregenerative Systems**: Algae, duckweed, and hydroponic farms
- **Mars-Ready**: Specifically designed for Jezero Crater
- **Sustainable**: Zero environmental impact, 95%+ resource recovery
- **Safe**: Perchlorate-safe processing with iron oxide catalysts

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.5.4 with Turbopack
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.1.14
- **Build Tool**: PostCSS
- **Code Quality**: ESLint
